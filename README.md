# Nonparametric Statistics Graduate Project

* [Seems to be a requirement for Mac](https://www.xquartz.org/)

### Check-in 1

TODO:
- [x] Store matrices in array
- [x] Find Mean Matrix
- [x] Find Average Misorientation Angle

**Functions**

* **makeArray(dataframe)**: turns dataframe into an array of matrices
* **meanMat(array)**: takes an array of matrices and returns the mean matrix **M**
* **misorientAngle(array, observation)**: takes an array of matrices and the intended observation in which an angle is to be found and returns said angle. If no observation is given, returns the average angle of the array.
